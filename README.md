About the Packages Used
pandas: It is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. It is not used for development. It is used purely for data processing.

MarkerCluster: Is a Folium plugin which adds marker clusters to a map using in-browser rendering.

HeatMap: Is a Folium plugin which adds a heat map layer to the base map. Note: You need to generate a base map before you can add a heat map layer.

Marker: Is a Folium plugin which adds a marker to a map using in-browser rendering.

math: Is a Python module which provides access to the mathematical functions, such as the factorial of a number, as defined by the C standard.

Seaborn: Is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.
